# Face-Recognition-Based-Student-Attendance-System-
This app allows students to register their face using a webcam, and later mark their attendance simply by showing their face in front of the cameraâ€”no manual input needed! The system accurately detects and matches faces with previously registered images, updates the attendance database, and prevents duplicate entries for the same day.
